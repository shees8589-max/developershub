❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their medical and health-related attributes.

This model helps in early detection of heart disease, which is critical in medical decision-making.
